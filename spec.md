## **PDF Merger Application Specification**

### **1. Overview**

The PDF Merger is a minimalistic, Windows-based desktop application that allows users to merge multiple PDF files into a single PDF. The application should be straightforward to use, requiring no additional setup or configuration. It will feature drag-and-drop file selection, a basic user interface, and auto-update functionality. The application is optimized for Windows 11 and will only be available as a 64-bit executable.

### **2. Features and Functionality**

#### **File Selection:**
- Users can select PDF files by either:
  - Dragging and dropping files into the application window.
  - Using a file picker dialog to browse for and select PDF files.
  
#### **Reordering Files:**
- Once files are selected, the user can reorder the PDFs before merging.
- A list view will display the selected PDF files. Users can drag to reorder the files or use a simple arrow button to move them up or down.

#### **Removing Files:**
- Users can remove files from the list before merging via a "Remove" button or a simple "Delete" action on the list item.

#### **Merging Process:**
- The user will press a "Merge" button to initiate the merging process.
- The application will merge the PDFs in the order they appear in the list.
- There are no additional options for selective page merging or inserting blank pages. The PDFs are merged as-is.

#### **Output File:**
- The output PDF will be saved to the **Desktop** by default.
- The filename will be sequential (e.g., `Merged_1.pdf`, `Merged_2.pdf`, etc.). If a file with the same name exists, the user will be prompted to overwrite it.
  
#### **File Handling:**
- The application will automatically check for existing `Merged_X.pdf` files on the Desktop and pick the next available sequential number for the output file.
  
#### **Progress Indication:**
- A spinner will appear during the merging process to indicate progress.
- Once merging is complete, the resulting PDF will automatically open in the default PDF viewer.

#### **Error Handling:**
- If an invalid file is selected (non-PDF file), the application will display a clear error message (e.g., "Invalid file format. Please select only PDF files.").
- If there is an issue during the merging process (e.g., file access error), an error message will notify the user.

#### **Auto-Update:**
- On startup, the application will check for updates.
- Updates will be downloaded and installed automatically when the application exits.
  
#### **Log Files:**
- Logs will be stored in the same folder as the executable.
- The logs will include actions taken, errors encountered, and other relevant application events.
  
### **3. Architecture and Design Choices**

- **Platform:** Windows 11 (64-bit only)
- **User Interface:** Minimalistic with a simple list of files to be merged, a spinner for progress indication, and a "Merge" button.
- **File Handling:** PDFs are merged in the order they appear in the list. The output is saved with a sequential filename.
- **Log Handling:** Simple logging for debugging and tracking errors. Log file is stored alongside the executable.
- **Auto-Update:** The application will check for updates on startup and install updates when the application is closed.
  
### **4. Data Handling**

- **Input:** The application accepts multiple PDF files selected by the user. It does not restrict file size or number, relying on the system's resources to handle large or numerous PDFs.
- **Output:** A single merged PDF, saved to the Desktop with a sequential filename.
- **Logs:** Errors and actions will be logged in plain text files located in the same folder as the executable.

### **5. Error Handling Strategies**

- **Invalid File Type:** If a non-PDF file is selected, an error message will notify the user: "Invalid file format. Please select only PDF files."
- **Merge Failure:** If there is a failure during the merge (e.g., file access error), the user will receive a message like: "An error occurred while merging the files. Please try again."
- **File Overwrite Warning:** If a file with the same name already exists, the user will be prompted to overwrite or cancel the operation.

### **6. Testing Plan**

- **Unit Tests:**
  - Verify correct sequential filename generation (e.g., checking that `Merged_X.pdf` is created and increments correctly).
  - Test for valid and invalid file selection (ensuring only PDF files can be selected).
  - Check the merging of multiple PDFs into a single file.
  
- **Integration Tests:**
  - Ensure drag-and-drop functionality works as expected.
  - Test file picker dialog to select PDFs.
  - Test user interface elements, ensuring that the reorder, remove, and merge buttons function correctly.

- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**
  - Simulate common user workflows: drag and drop, reorder files, merge, check if the resulting PDF opens, verify output filename generation.
  - Test auto-update functionality (check that updates are detected, downloaded, and installed correctly).
  - Verify error messages display appropriately for invalid files or issues during merging.

- **Performance Tests:**
  - Test the application with varying numbers of PDFs (e.g., 2 files, 50 files) to ensure it can handle a wide range of inputs.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - Test with extremely large PDF files (e.g., files over 1GB).
  - Test with files named similarly (e.g., `Merged_1.pdf`, `Merged_2.pdf`) to ensure the system correctly handles file naming conflicts.
  - Test the handling of locked files (e.g., files currently in use by another application).

### **7. Additional Notes**

- The application will be distributed as a standalone executable, with no installation process required. Users will simply download and run the program.
- The design is intentionally minimalistic to ensure ease of use, with a focus on core functionality (merging PDFs).
